Optimize for simplicity first Write code for humans, not computers Reading is more important than writing Any style is fine, as long as it’s black There should be one way to do it, but seriously this time Hide the sharp knives Changing the rules is better than adding exceptions Libraries are better than frameworks Transitive dependencies are a problem Dynamic runtime dependencies are a bigger problem API surface area is a liability Returning early is a good thing Use more plain text Compiler errors are better than runtime errors Runtime errors are better than bugs Tooling is better than documentation Documentation is better than nothing Configuration sucks, but so does convention The cost of building a feature is its smallest cost Types are one honking great idea – let’s do more of those!

We’ve been told it’s the way to land a good job and to make more money. But is it?
I think that most college degrees these days commit a cardinal sin in the business world. College degrees are solutions in search of a problem.
What is a solution in search of a problem?

Allow me to clear up my thoughts on Go’s errors. Overall, I prefer how Go forces me to think about errors at every turn. When working in try/catch languages like JavaScript, I often easily forget which functions can throw. Even if I do remember, it’s easy to think “I think this gets caught somewhere up the call chain”.

Sometimes an idea is so good, that you can’t argue with it. I’m not saying that the original idea behind “DevOps” was perfect - I’ve written about some of the specific issues I’ve seen. That said, I think there is enough data and research behind the core ideas by now that there are very few companies willing to admit they don’t “do DevOps”.

It’s even harder if you tend to be a more introverted person. However, learning how to say “no” effectively can help your career. I certainly have struggled over the years with saying “no” as a programmer, after all, wouldn’t a good programmertm be able to do anything?
Let’s look at some example scenarios where perhaps you should be saying “no” more often.

Last night I switched away from Verizon as my cell phone provider. The process of wrestling my phone number out of their grubby clutches and into control of my new carrier had me raving like a madman by the end of the night. I had a similar experience when trying to quit my local Vasa gym. While I’m sure you’re familiar with an unnecessarily difficult cancellation process, this might be the first time you’ve heard it referred to as a “dark pattern”.

Most applications I’ve worked on have a RESTful scheme, a GraphQL implementation, or a more strict gRPC system. I’ve used REST for the most part, probably just because it’s what I’m familiar with, but I hate it. Every time I design a new API I can’t help but think that it shouldn’t be so hard to come up with a sane way to communicate between the server and the client.

I’m sure there are a lot of people out there who know a lot more about growing relevant organic traffic for businesses than I do, but I’ve become convinced of something that I’d like to run by you.

I’ve been hacking away at Boot.dev since March 2020, and for the most part, it’s been a ton of fun. However, at the end of the day, if you want your project to earn you enough cash that you can quit your day job, you have to work on some things that are less fun.

I went to church weekly, paid tithing, and even served a 2-year proselyting and service mission in Paraguay from when I was 18 until I was 20. A few years after returning home, I ended up leaving the church after a long process of research that led me to the conclusion that the Mormon Church almost certainly wasn’t “the true church”.

It felt like a platform with all the conveniences of Medium’s writing tools but wasn’t missing the features that developers need, like code blocks and markdown. I still think Dev.to probably has the best writing experience of any third-party blogging platform for devs, luckily that hasn’t changed at all. On the other hand, the reading experience, or rather the content on the platform, has dropped so hard and fast in quality that I realized a few months ago that I haven’t opened my feed in almost a year.

If you have data that depends on other data, try not to store it.
If you follow this rule, you can deliver your code faster, mainly because you will avoid lengthy and painful data migrations.
The guiding principle behind this call to action is that data at rest is more dangerous than data in motion.

That said, I have met some, and I think their hesitation is usually rooted in the myth that continuous deployment causes more disruptions to end-users than a batched release cycle.
What is continuous deployment? Before we get into the nitty-gritty of why continuous deployment (CD) is almost always better than batched releases, let’s define some terms.

While I’m a fan of Agile, I’m not a huge fan of one of its more common interpretations - a Scrum-based workflow. Let’s discuss why I generally prefer a “Kanban” workflow to traditional Scrum. If you’ve read my first article, you’ll know I’m not Scrum’s biggest fan.

In fact, we use Go on the front and backend at Boot.dev, and we’ve found that it’s wonderful to have standardized formatting, vetting, and testing across the entire Go ecosystem. The first big criticism I’ve had with Go’s opinionated nature is with the way the Go toolchain handles major versions. It slows down development in a significant number of scenarios and is a detriment to the average developer’s experience. PubDate:Tue, 15 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000} {Title:Optimize For Simplicity First Link:https://wagslane.dev/posts/optimize-for-simplicit-first/ Description:We can’t optimize for everything when developing software, so we need to start with something, and that something should be simple code and simple architecture. For example, to over-optimize for speed in JavaScript, we might write our for-loops backwards to the detriment of readability.
I believe we should optimize for simplicity first, and only make complex memory, speed, and abstraction changes as they become necessary.
But muh speed If it’s slow but readable, I can make it fast.

Let’s dive into how inefficient field ordering in Go structs can have a huge impact on the memory footprint of a program.
Our Situation The vast majority of the allocated memory in our case was due to an enormous slice of stats structs. PubDate:Fri, 07 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000} {Title:Your Manager Can’t Code? They Shouldn’t Be Your Manager Link:https://wagslane.dev/posts/managers-that-cant-code/ Description:Managers who can’t code are an outdated artifact of corporate America circa 2005. The best managers that I’ve had spend ~80% of their time coding, architecting, or doing technical work that requires engineering experience. If your manager thinks coding and other technical work is “beneath” them then they need a dose of humble pie. Your organization would likely be better off without them.
But Managers Manage People! There is a long-running stigma associated with developers.

If your goal as a manager is to implement a system by which you:
Speed up the appearance of progress Pay for twice the amount of people you need Gather approximate data based on meaningless metrics Then Scrum is exactly what you’re looking for!
“Oh you had problems with Scrum at your last employer? Well, that’s not real Scrum.

Read on and I‘ll point out only the most egregious examples that the author, Tad R. Callister, makes in his book full of misleading logic and fallacious claims.
Disclaimer If you have access to the original book, you’ll notice that Callister makes the same errors over and over in many disparate sections of the book.
